This application offers a straightforward interface for getting new advice.

1.  **Getting Advice:**
    Upon loading, the application will automatically fetch and display an initial piece of advice.

2.  **Generating New Advice:**
    To get a new, different piece of advice, simply click on the **green dice icon button** located at the bottom of the advice box. The application will fetch a new slip and update the displayed text.

3.  **Handling Loading States:**
    While a new advice slip is being fetched, a spinner will appear, indicating that content is loading.
